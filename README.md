What you need to know about Web Services and how to build one



An API, or an application programing interface, is a collection of code-based directives that facilitate communication and data exchange between different software modules. Web Services have a long history and now serve as fundamental components of contemporary applications. Whether you're making a purchase through an online store, requesting transportation from a ride-sharing platform, or placing an order from a restaurant delivery service, you're utilizing web services. Web service development is thus an essential skill for individuals entering the technology field.

Here, we'll guide you through the process of constructing a basic RESTful APIs, emphasizing both design and implementation.

STEPS TO BUILD THE API:

Step 1: Design the Web Service
The initial phase in crafting the API involves gaining a clear understanding of its intended functionality. Each API serves a distinct purpose, whether facilitating bi-directional video streaming or managing authentication procedures. Hence, it's imperative to delineate the API's use case and scope prior to selecting an architecture, protocol, and programming language.

Subsequently, one must delineate the essential resources, their required data formats and structures, interrelationships, and the permissible methods accessible through their respective endpoints. For more intricate APIs intended for production environments, factors such as authentication and encryption need to be addressed to uphold data integrity and security.

Creating a visual representation, such as a diagram, can aid in conceptualizing the API's resources and their relationships. For instance, envisioning a scenario where a pet daycare business aims to develop an API for tracking pets and their owners, a diagram could be constructed to illustrate these relationships effectively.


Step 2: Implement the Web Service
Executing the API entails utilizing diverse programming languages, architectures, and protocols. While REST remains widely adopted, alternatives such as Webhooks, GraphQL, SOAP, and gRPC also enjoy popularity. Furthermore, APIs can be implemented across various programming languages, including but not limited to Node.js, Python, Java, and Ruby. To illustrate, for the purpose of this demonstration, we'll employ Ruby on Rails to establish a straightforward REST API for the pet tracking application outlined earlier.

Why have we opted for Ruby on Rails?

Ruby on Rails, commonly referred to as "Rails," presents an advantageous framework for initiating API development, particularly for newcomers, as it abstracts numerous intricacies associated with typical API construction tasks, such as routing and database interaction. Its inclusion of a command line utility, rails generate (or rails g), facilitates the automatic generation of essential API components. Consequently, Rails stands as a suitable choice for developers across all skill levels and accommodates a broad spectrum of applications and API implementations.

Prior to delving into code composition, let's acquaint ourselves with several key Rails concepts:

- Models: Corresponding to database tables or collections, models enforce business rules, validate data, and execute database operations. Each resource within the API corresponds to a model.
- Migrations: Rails migrations offer a method for managing alterations to the database schema, enabling developers to modify tables, columns, and indexes sans direct SQL scripting.
- Controllers: Responsible for orchestrating data flow between clients and the database, controllers receive user input, interact with models for data retrieval or manipulation, and, in full-stack Rails applications, update views for result presentation. Notably, this tutorial focuses solely on API development, hence the view aspect is irrelevant.
- Routes: Rails routes establish mappings between URLs and actions within controllers. Upon receiving a request, the routing mechanism directs it to an appropriate controller action based on the URL path and HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE).

Creating an API

Having finalized the design phase as outlined earlier, it's now imperative to proceed with the implementation of your API. Prior to commencing, ensure that Ruby, Rails, and SQLite are installed on your local machine. For detailed guidance regarding these prerequisites, refer to the Rails documentation through this link *https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project*. therefore 

Step 1: Create a new Rails application by using the rails new command from your command line:

rails new pet_tracker --api


Step 3: Test the Web Service
